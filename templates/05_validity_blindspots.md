# 05 Validity and Blind Spots

## Construct Validity
- Does metric really measure policy following?

## Internal Validity
- Potential confounders/leakage:

## External Validity
- Generalization limits (tasks/models/policies):

## Robustness Coverage
- Adversarial prompts:
- Ambiguous/conflicting policies:
- Long-horizon behavior:
- Tool-use constraints:

## Reproducibility
- Missing implementation/eval details:
