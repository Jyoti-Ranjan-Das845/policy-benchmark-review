Abstract
Existing benchmarks do not test language agents on their interaction with human
users or ability to follow domain-specific rules, both of which are vital for deploying
them in real world applications. We propose τ-bench, a benchmark emulating
dynamic conversations between a user (simulated by language models) and a
language agent provided with domain-specific API tools and policy guidelines.
We employ an efficient and faithful evaluation process that compares the database
state at the end of a conversation with the annotated goal state. We also propose
a new metric (pass^k) to evaluate the reliability of agent behavior over multiple
trials. Our experiments show that even state-of-the-art function calling agents (like
gpt-4o) succeed on < 50% of the tasks, and are quite inconsistent (pass^8 < 25%
in retail). Our findings point to the need for methods that can improve the ability
of agents to act consistently and follow rules reliably.
1 Introduction
There is increasing excitement around the potential of language agents [20, 24, 18, 1] to enable new
levels of automation across various industries. However, their deployment in real-world systems
requires several key desiderata to be satisfied. Agents must (1) interact seamlessly with both humans
and programmatic APIs over long horizons to incrementally gather information and resolve intents,
(2) accurately adhere to complex policies and rules specific to a task or domain, and (3) maintain
consistency and reliability at scale, across millions of interactions. For instance, consider the case of
an airline booking agent (Figure 1). When a user wants to change their flight reservation to a different
destination airport, the agent needs to gather the required information by interacting with the user,
check the airline policies using the guidelines provided, and find new flights and (if possible) rebook
the user using complex reservation APIs. In addition, the agent should be consistent in its behavior
across different kinds of users with the same request, and robust to small changes in the conversation
flow that should not affect the end outcome.
Modeling realistic human interaction and rule following in agent evaluation is vital for developing
and deploying trustworthy agents in the wild, and tackling challenges like long-context reasoning
and planning in a methodical fashion. Existing benchmarks [27, 29, 12, 14, 16] for language agents
often feature simplified instruction-following setups, where the agent autonomously interacts with an
environment (web, code terminal, or APIs) given all the information upfront, without any human-in-
the-loop interaction and without the need to consult any domain-specific guidelines.
In this work, we introduce τ-bench (short for Tool-Agent-User Interaction Benchmark) to measure
an agent’s ability to interact with (simulated) human users and programmatic APIs while following
domain-specific policies in a consistent manner. τ-bench is built in a modular framework with
(1) realistic databases and APIs, (2) domain-specific policy documents, and (3) instructions for

diverse user scenarios and corresponding ground truth annotations. As a first demonstration, we
focus on the realm of customer service and create two different domains where agents need to assist
simulated users with diverse requests (τ -retail and τ -airline). We leverage the generative capabilities
of language models (LMs) for data creation and realistic human user simulation [15] in conjunction
with manual annotation and verification.
We constructed τ-bench in three stages, including manual schema and API design, LM-assisted
generation of data entries, and manual scenario generation and verification for the user simulator.
Our evaluation scheme compares the database state at the end of each episode with the ground truth
expected state. This allows for objective measurement of the agent’s decision making, while also
providing room for stochastic variation in the conversation itself, since the user may pose the same
request in different ways that result in the same end state of the database. We also introduce the
metric of pass^k, which measures the consistency and robustness of the agent across k i.i.d. trials.
Our experiments reveal that agents built with simple LM constructs (like function calling or ReAct)
perform poorly, highlighting the need for more sophisticated agent architectures. For instance, even
state-of-the-art LMs like gpt-4o achieve low task success rates (pass^1) using function calling
(∼61% on τ-retail and ∼35% on τ-airline). With increasing k, the chance of consistently solving a
task drops rapidly, to as low as ∼25% for pass^8 on τ-retail for the same model. This showcases
the fragile nature of such agents in handling stochasticity and partial information, which is common
in human-agent interaction. Upon analyzing the failure cases, we find that current agents struggle
with complex reasoning over databases, understanding and following ad-hoc policies, and handling
compound (more than one) requests. We hope that τ-bench enables the evaluation and development
of more consistent and capable agents for real-world digital tasks involving human interaction.
2 Related Work
Most existing benchmarks for agents and task-oriented dialogue systems focus on evaluating either
conversational or tool-use capabilities. τ-bench aims to unify both under realistic settings, while also
testing how well agents can follow domain-specific policies in a consistent manner.
Benchmarks for language agents and tool use. Several benchmarks have been developed to
evaluate agents powered by LMs [27, 29, 12, 14, 16] . Recent efforts have focused specifically on
evaluating tool use capabilities of LMs, i.e., their ability to generate the right function calls from a
set of functions in an API. Projects like the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) [ 23],
2

ToolBench [22] and MetaTool [11] test tool use/function calling in multiple programming languages
and propose various methods for evaluating the accuracy of function calls. ToolEmu [ 16] uses
language models themselves to emulate the execution of tools, with a focus on exposing potential
safety risks when LM agents fail to use tools correctly. However, all these works only contain a
single-step user interaction, where the human interacting with the agent provides an initial instruction
containing all the required information. In contrast, our benchmark focuses on a more realistic setting
where the agent has to interact with human users to gather information and authorization.
Task-oriented dialogue. Task-oriented dialogue has been a long-standing challenge for NLP, with
several efforts over the years to build domain-specific offline datasets or user simulators. The former
types of benchmarks are static and only test the conversational agent on pre-collected conversation
trajectories[4, 3, 2]. The latter either rely on user simulators that are rule-based or rely on symbolic
specifications [ 17, 8] or perform tests with real humans through crowdsourcing platforms [9]. Some
very recent work explores the use of LMs as response raters to train dialogue systems [10] or evaluates
their capability for simulating users [7]. τ-bench leverages the powerful text generation capabilities
of state-of-the-art LMs to simulate realistic user utterances and long-context conversations using
textual scenario descriptions, with the goal of evaluating agents. The stochastic sampling from LMs
allows for diverse yet faithful variations in the dialogue when re-run with the exact scenario – this is
extremely useful for testing agent consistency, as we show in § 5.1.
User simulation with LMs. Our work is also related to recent efforts on using LMs as simulators
of human characters. This includes papers on simulating non-player characters (NPCs) in text
adventure games [13] multiple agents in human-like societies [15] or specific collaborative tasks [21],
and enabling human-in-the-loop interaction for tasks like online shopping [ 6] or web search [28].
However, all these past works have not used such simulators to benchmark the reliability of agents,
instead focusing on showcasing the ability of LMs to enable realistic simulations. Our work uses
such realistic user simulation to provide an accurate assessment of the reliability and robustness of
AI agents for deployment in systems that undertake millions of real-world interactions with humans.
3 τ -bench: A benchmark for T ool-Agent-User Interaction
Each individual task in τ-bench can be formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process
(POMDP) (S, A, O, T , R, U ) with state space S, action space A, observation space O, transition
function T : S × A → S × O , reward function R : S → [0, 1], and instruction space U. The agent
interacts with both (1) databases (db) via API tools, and (2) a (simulated) user (user) to complete a
task, i.e., S = Sdb ⊗ Suser, A = Adb ∪ Auser, O = Odb ∪ Ouser. In addition, the agent is provided a
domain-specific policy document containing rules it must adhere to – one can think of this as partially
describing the world model of the domain. We describe each component in more detail below.
Databases and APIs. Each τ-bench domain has several databases and associated APIs. The
contents of the database form the state sdb (Figure 2a), which is hidden from the agent and the
user, and can only be read from or written to using API actions adb, which are usually in the
form tool_name(**kwargs). When an action is executed on the database, the transition Tdb :
(sdb, adb) 7→ (s′
db, odb) is deterministic and implemented as a Python function (Figure 2b).
Domain policy. Each domain has a policy (Figure 2c) that explains the domain databases, task proce-
dures, and restrictions for the agent to follow in its interactions. Some restrictions are implemented
as checks in the API, e.g., using a payment ID not in the user profile will lead to odb = "Error:
payment not found" , and others not, e.g., the airline policy states different baggage allowances for
different membership statuses and cabin classes, but the agent needs to fill in the number of baggage
items to be paid for in the book_reservation API, similar to the freedom given real-world agents.
User simulation. We use a language model (gpt-4-0613) to simulate a human user interacting with
the agent. The user state suser consists of an initial system prompt with the task instruction (Figure 2d)
along with the entire conversation history between the user and the agent so far. The user cannot see the
interaction history between the agent and API tools. The agent can interact with the user using any nat-
ural language message, e.g., auser can be "Your reservation has been updated, is there
anything else I can help with?" . The transition Tuser : ( suser, auser) 7→ (s′
user, ouser) is
stochastic and attaches the agent’s message to the chat history followed by sampling a new user mes-
sage from the LM, e.g., ouser can then be "Yes, I also want to cancel another flight."
When the user issues ouser="###STOP###", the episode finishes and the agent is evaluated.

(d) User instruction ensures only one possible outcome.
Figure 2: τ-bench is constructed in a modular fashion with several components: (a) JSON databases,
(b) Python API tools, (c) Markdown domain policies, and (d) JSON task instances. The agent can
only access API tools and domain policies, and indirectly access databases via API tools. Task
annotation is not visible to the agent and is used only for user simulation and evaluation.
Task instances. As shown in Figure 2d, each τ-bench task instance has two parts: an instruction
for the user simulation (hidden from agents), and an annotation of the ground truth database write
actions (and optionally, ground truth outputs for user questions). The instruction sets up user identity,
intent, and preferences in a way that guarantees only one possible outcome under the domain policy.
Each task episode consists of the simulated user starting with a request, which the agent handles in
a conversational manner while being able to call tools at any point and refer to the provided policy.
Once the episode ends, the database state and agent-to-user messages are used to compute the reward.
Reward. The reward of a task episode r = raction × routput ∈ {0, 1} is based on (1) whether the final
database is identical to the unique ground truth outcome database (raction), and (2) whether the agent’s
responses to the user contain all necessary information (routput). So for the task of Figure 2d, the agent-
user dialogue can be varied and the agent can call various (read) actions, but the agent is successful
if the only database write action is return_delivered_order_items(order_id="#W2890441",
item_ids=["2366567022"], payment_method_id="credit_card_1061405") , and the user
responses contain "54.04", "41.64" as substrings. Note that r = 1 might be a necessary but not
sufficient condition for a successful episode e.g., the agent might issue the return without explicit
user confirmation, which violates the policy. Nevertheless, our proposed rule-based reward is fast to
compute and faithful, and already poses significant challenges for current models and methods as we
show in § 5.
Pass^k metric. For tasks like code generation with good verification techniques (unit tests), the
community has defined the pass@k (pass at k) metric as the chance that at least one out ofk i.i.d. task
trials is successful, which captures the trend of agents enabling discovery of solutions with scaling
of inference-time compute [5]. For real-world agent tasks requiring reliability and consistency like
customer service, we propose a new metric – pass^k (pass hat k), defined as the chance that all k
i.i.d. task trials are successful, averaged across tasks. Therefore, if a task is run for n trials and c of

In our case, for the same task, the user prompt and database transitions are the same, with just the
LM sampling of the user and agent messages generating sufficient stochasticity. Thus, pass^k can
capture the reliability of the agent at handling variations in conversations with the same underlying
semantics while adhering to the domain policies and rules. By default, we report the average reward
across tasks, pass^1=pass@1=E[r] = E[c/n], as the main metric for comparing agents.
4 Benchmark Construction
τ-bench defines domain-agnostic environment and user simulation classes shared by various domains,
and domain-specific data in terms of database JSON files, database API Python code and documenta-
tion, domain policy text, and task instances. Each domain is created in a three-stage approach with a
mix of LM and code runs, and human labeling and checking.
Stage I: Manual design of database schema, APIs, and policies. We start by co-designing the
simplest possible database schemas, APIs, and policies with inspiration (and simplification) from their
real-world counterparts. Simplicity is important for the logical consistency of various components
and the ease of API and task annotation. Still, a minimally realistic domain requires at least tens of
schemas, APIs, rules, and turns out to be challenging enough for existing agents. See § B.1 for more.
Stage II: Automatic data generation with LMs. Once the data schema is set up, we create an
example entry and use gpt-4 to generate a systematic code snippet to sample scalable entries, and
manually polish minor bugs in the code. See § B.2 for an example snippet and more details.
Stage III: Manual task annotation and validation with agent runs. Here, the key challenge is
to ensure the user instruction leads to a unique database outcome. For example, if the preferred
payment method is not specified, the user might answer differently and cause the final database to be
different across trials. So we write an initial user instruction, run a trial with gpt-4-turbo function
calling agent, polish the user instruction by examining the trajectory, and do this iteratively until
we are certain no ambiguities exist (see Figure 7 in § A, where we run each τ-retail task with > 40
gpt-4-turbo trials and check all tasks with zero or low success rates). We can copy and edit agent
actions and outputs for ground truth annotation, which is easier than annotating from scratch.
In practice, we might update minor details of database schemas or policies during data or task creation,
but the three stages are mostly linear, and the constructed data is organized in a modular structure.
4.1 Domains
Using the above procedures, we modularly construct two domains, τ-retail and τ-airline. We choose
these two domains as they are relatively easy to synthesize data (e.g., products, prices, flights) and
craft policies (e.g., product return, baggage allowance) based on common sense, allow for diverse
tasks, and are close to real-world applications. For more capable agents in the future, more advanced
domains (e.g., medical, tax, or legal) with more complex data and rules can be studied. Below, we
briefly describe the domain policies of two domains (full details of the domains in § B.1).
τ -retail. In this domain, the agent is tasked with helping users cancel or modify pending orders,
return or exchange delivered orders, modify user addresses, or provide information. Each product
(e.g., “Water Bottle” in Figure 2a) has various item options with unique IDs (e.g., 1000ml, stainless
steel, blue). Each pending order can only be canceled or modified once, and each delivered order can
only be returned or exchanged once. An item cannot be modified or exchanged for another product
5

type. These constraints simplify task and API design, and challenge agents to follow domain-specific
rules, and inform and collect complete information from users before taking actions.
τ -airline. Here, the agent has to help users book, modify, or cancel flight reservations, or provide
refunds. We construct 300 flights between 20 US cities with realistic durations and prices, and
API tools to query direct or one-stop flights. The domain policy is more complex than τ-retail,
with ad-hoc constraints about combining payment methods, checked bag allowance, flight changes
and cancellations, etc. These constraints can also be over membership tier and cabin class specific,
creating challenging multi-hop reasoning puzzles for the agent.
4.2 Key Characteristics
Realistic dialogue and tool use. Compared to prior task-oriented dialogue benchmarks, τ-bench
has more complex databases and realistic user simulations thanks to the advances of LMs. Some
trajectories can be seen in § C.2 and § D.2. Notably, even if the user instruction is synthetic, the user
utterances generated via LMs are open-ended and natural-sounding.
Open-ended and diverse tasks. Each τ-bench domain’s data schemas, APIs, and rules are simplified
compared to real-world domains, but they are rich enough to support the creation of extremely diverse,
open-ended, and sometimes creative tasks (see § A, § C.2, § D.2). Importantly, we trade off quantity
for quality — as § 5 shows, running a small set of high-quality tasks for multiple trials (with pass^k
metric) can reliably reveal rich insights into different models, methods, and research challenges.
Faithful rule-based evaluation. Real-world agents are hard to evaluate as the trajectory can be
extremely diverse for the same task, and success criteria are multi-faceted. As a result, it often requires
human evaluation, e.g., end users to judge task resolution and domain experts to judge rule following.
In τ-bench, we trade off slow, careful task annotation for fast, faithful evaluation. By ensuring that
only one database outcome is possible based on domain policies and user desires, subjective and
noisy human judgments can be replaced by simple and objective database state comparisons.
Modular extension. The codebase structure of τ-bench is modular, and it is easy to add new
domains to τ-bench, or add or update database entries, domain functionalities, rules, APIs, tasks, and
evaluation metrics (given they are consistent with the existing domain data). We release our codebase
publicly to encourage the community to create new tasks and domains for τ-bench.
5 Experiments
Models. We test various state-of-the-art proprietary and open language models for agents
through their APIs: OpenAI GPT API ( gpt-4o, gpt-4-turbo, gpt-4-32k, gpt-3.5-turbo),
Anthropic Claude API (claude-3-opus, claude-3-sonnet, claude-3-haiku), Google Gemini
API ( gemini-1.5-pro-latest, gemini-1.5-flash-latest), Mistral API ( mistral-large,
open-mixtral-8x22b), AnyScale API (meta-llama-3-70B-instruct). Only the last two mod-
els openly release weights. We do not test small models (7/13B) due to the difficulty of the benchmark.
Methods. Our main method for building the agent is through the use of function calling (FC), which
is natively supported by all tested LMs except Llama-3. In FC mode, the model’s system prompt
is set to be the domain policy, and at each turn, the model autonomously decides to generate a user
response message or a tool call. We also test text-formatted ReAct [ 26] and its Act-only ablation,
where the model is instructed to zero-shot generate “Thought: {some reasoning} Action: {some
JSON format action argument}” or only the action part. Notably, some agent methods are not suitable
for a user-in-the-loop setup, e.g., self-reflection [19] is unrealistic as real-world agents only have one
chance to serve the user, and planning approaches [25] might be too slow to help a user in real time.
We limit each task to at most 30 agent actions (either tool calls or user responses). For main results
(Table 2), we run at least 3 trials per task. The LM temperature is 0.0 for agent and 1.0 for user.
5.1 Main results
Model comparison. From Table 2, we see that gpt-4o is the best model with function calling,
and there is a wide spectrum of performances among various models. Notably, SoTA open-weight
models (llama-3-70b and mistral-8x22b) still have a significant gap to cover with respect to SoTA

proprietary models (gpt-4o, claude-3-opus). All models are still far from solving τ-bench, especially
the more challenging τ-airlinewhere even gpt-4o solves only 35.2% of the tasks. The diversity of
model performances (shown in Table 2) and task difficulties (shown in Figure 7 in § A) as well as
large remaining gaps from perfect resolution makes τ-bench ideal for benchmarking and developing
new models for agents, tool use, and dialogue.
Method comparison. Figure 3 shows that natively supported function calling consistently out-
performs text-formatted agent methods with the state-of-the-art models. For text-formatted agent
methods, adding reasoning traces still consistently helps (compare ReAct vs. Act columns) as
it helps bridge the gap between observations and actions that have unfamiliar formats. We have
also experimented with adding a “think” function for function-calling agents, but it did not boost
performance, perhaps because most FC models have not been trained toward such reasoning.
Agent consistency via pass^k. As shown in Figure 4, the chance of reliably and consistently solving
the same task multiple times significantly drops as the number of trials k increases. Even for the
best-performing gpt-4o function calling agent which has a > 60% average task success, pass^8 drops
to < 25%. In real-world scenarios, it is important and challenging not just to build agents with high
average success (pass^1), but with more robustness and consistency (pass^k trend).
Cost analysis. When we pair gpt-4o FC agent with gpt-4 user simulation on τ-retail, the agent /
user simulation costs are $0.38 / $0.23 per task respectively, so running one trial per task costs around
200 dollars. For the agent, the input prompt / completion output take up 95.9% / 4.1% of the price
respectively, so the cost is mainly due to long system prompt (domain policy + function definitions).
5.2 Research challenge analysis
In this subsection, we analyze in both quantitative and qualitative terms the challenges of τ-bench,
with a focus on the τ-retail split and the most advanced baseline: gpt-4o function calling agent.

Figure 5: Breakdown of 36 failed
gpt-4o FC agent trajectories in τ-retail.
Failure breakdown. We sample 115 gpt-4o FC agent tra-
jectories in τ-retail (1 trial per task), out of which 40 tasks
have failed (pass^1=65.2%). Upon manual examination
of these failures, 4 of them are caused by user instruction
typo or ambiguity (and then fixed), and the remaining 36
failure cases are agent issues, which are broken down into
more detail below and in Figure 5.
Failure 1: Wrong argument or information provided:
the challenge of complex database reasoning. For
“wrong argument”, gpt-4o FC agent usually makes the
right type of tool call(s) but fills in one or more arguments
incorrectly. In the example shown in § C.2.2, the user
7

wants to exchange a lamp for a less bright one and prefers
an AC adapter over battery or USB power source. The agent fails to reason over the complex inventory
of lamps and find the unique option given such a preference. Weaker models and methods struggle
with even more basic failures such as hallucinating arguments — for example, while gpt-4o FC
agent only makes 0.46 tool calls with non-existent user/product/order/item IDs per τ-retail task,
gpt-3.5-turbo FC / Act agents make 2.08 / 6.34, respectively.
For “wrong info”, agents omit user-required information (e.g., the user asks for a tracking ID but the
agent does not provide it), or calculate the wrong information (e.g., wrong total price), or provide the
user with incorrect information that causes the user request to diverge (e.g., the user might cancel or
exchange based on incorrect price information provided by the agent). These failures account for
˜55% of overall failures and highlight the need for improved common sense and numerical reasoning
over complex databases and user intents for future models.
Failure 2: Incorrect decision-making: the challenge of domain understanding and rule following.
While the above failures can be recognized even without referring to the domain policy, “wrong
decision-making” failures (25% of overall failures) occur as the agent fails to understand the domain-
specific knowledge or rules and makes the wrong type of tool call. In the example of § C.2.1, the user
wants to exchange “a couple of items”, and according to the domain policy, “Exchange or modify
order tools can only be called once. Be sure that all items to be exchanged are collected into a list
before making the tool call”. However, the gpt-4o FC agent omits the domain knowledge and rule
and decides to exchange one item first, resulting in the second item not being exchanged.
τ-retail τ-airline
gpt-4o 61.2 → 56.8 33.2 → 10.8
gpt-3.5 20.0 → 14.5 10.8 → 9.6
Table 3: pass^1 scores degrade when
the domain policy is not provided in the
agent’s system prompt.
To further understand how different agents follow rules in
different domains, we perform an ablation study by remov-
ing the domain policy from the FC agent system prompt.
As seen in Table 3, in τ-retail where rules are simpler and
closer to commonsense, gpt-4o and gpt-3.5-turbo
agents only degrade 4.4% and 5.5% in terms of pass^1,
suggesting that their successful cases mostly stem from
using tools in an intuitive and common sense way, and that
they may not actually be leveraging the policy documents
to the extent possible. In τ-airline where rules are more complex and ad-hoc (e.g., baggage allowance
varies for different membership tiers and cabins), removing the policy hurts gpt-4o significantly
(−22.4%) but gpt-3.5-turbo only slightly (−1.2%), suggesting the former follows rules at times
but the latter does not has the capacity to process complex airline rules. Overall, τ-bench poses
significant challenges for function calling agents to follow complex domain dynamics and rules, and
showcases there is still work to be done in this direction. Domain-specific fine-tuning or agent code
scaffolding might provide some remedy, which can be important future work.

Figure 6: Retail tasks with more
database writes are harder.
Failure 3: Partial resolution of compound requests. Lastly, as
shown in Figure 6, when a task involves many user requests (rep-
resented by the number of ground truth write actions to databases),
it becomes more challenging for function calling agents (19% of
cases). Sometimes the agent omits explicit user requests at the
beginning of the conservation, hinting at the need for better long-
context and memory capabilities. Other times, the agent omits
implicit actions, such as in § C.2.3, where the user wants to fix
wrong addresses in all orders, but the agent stops after checking
only one order. Agents need to improve in their consistency and
systematicity in handling such cases.
6 Discussion
We have presented τ-bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating the reliability of agents in interacting
with humans and tools in dynamic and realistic settings. The benchmark leverages the latest advances
in LMs to simulate users, allows for automated testing of agents and provides an assessment of an
agent’s ability to follow domain-specific rules in a consistent manner. Our results show that even
SOTA LMs are far from being reliable for use in real-world settings.
8

Directions for improvement. While τ-bench is a step towards dynamic evaluation of agents in
real-world scenarios, there are several directions for improvement. The simulated user can have
some limitations: (1) the user instruction might contain typos or ambiguities, which annotators can
examine and fix; (2) the user instruction may not contain all domain knowledge, e.g., in § C.2.1,
the user authorizes the single item exchange without knowing that the agent could only issue one
exchange action, which reflects real-world users who (rightfully) do not know complex domain
policies; or (3) the user simulation LM might have limited capacity at reasoning, calculation, long-
context memorization, or alignment with the instruction prompt, e.g., in § C.2.2 the user authorizes
the agent-recommended lamp without double checking its features. While these can all be improved
in future work, one can also argue that this is indicative of the real world where users can have a wide
range of skill sets and knowledge, and the onus is on the agents to handle diverse users.
In addition, one can also add more systematic checks to the simulator to ensure unique outcomes.
The domain policies can also be made more complex to match real-world scenarios. More evaluation
metrics can be added to define agent success (e.g., LM checks that certain rules are followed). The
manual annotation process for the benchmark is difficult and requires a deep understanding of both
the domain and agent capabilities. There is also some element of implicit bias during the task
curation process since we use the gpt-4-turbo FC agent to tune the user’s system prompt. Future
work can investigate alternative ways of using LMs for improving data curation and user simulation.
Finally, while we don’t believe this work has potential negative societal implications directly, it helps
real-world agents which can have various consequences for the economy and society in the future.
Challenges for agents. At the core, the main results from our experiments demonstrate a critical
fact: agents built on top of LM function calling lack sufficient consistency and rule-following ability
to reliably build real-world applications. Solving both of these problems can have outsized impact
on automating several real-world tasks and ensuring smoother human-in-the-loop interaction. Other
specific features to improve in agents include long-horizon information tracking and memory, as well
as the ability to focus on the right pieces of information in context for the decision at hand, especially
when there may be conflicting facts present.

Retail policies
# Retail agent policy
As a retail agent, you can help users cancel or modify pending orders, return or
exchange delivered orders, modify their default user address, or provide
information about their own profile, orders, and related products.
- At the beginning of the conversation, you have to authenticate the user identity
by locating their user id via email, or via name + zip code. This has to be done
even when the user already provides the user id.
- Once the user has been authenticated, you can provide the user with information
about order, product, profile information, e.g. help the user look up order id.
- You can only help one user per conversation (but you can handle multiple
requests from the same user), and must deny any requests for tasks related to any
other user.
- Before taking consequential actions that update the database (cancel, modify,
return, exchange), you have to list the action detail and obtain explicit user
confirmation (yes) to proceed.
15

- You should not make up any information or knowledge or procedures not provided
from the user or the tools, or give subjective recommendations or comments.
- You should at most make one tool call at a time, and if you take a tool call,
you should not respond to the user at the same time. If you respond to the user,
you should not make a tool call.
- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot
be handled within the scope of your actions.
## Domain basic
- All times in the database are EST and 24 hour based. For example "02:30:00"
means 2:30 AM EST.
- Each user has a profile of its email, default address, user id, and payment
methods. Each payment method is either a gift card, a paypal account, or a credit
card.
- Our retail store has 50 types of products. For each type of product, there are
variant items of different options. For example, for a 't shirt ' product, there
could be an item with option 'color blue size M ', and another item with option
'color red size L '.
- Each product has an unique product id, and each item has an unique item id. They
have no relations and should not be confused.
- Each order can be in status 'pending', 'processed', 'delivered', or 'cancelled'.
Generally, you can only take action on pending or delivered orders.
- Exchange or modify order tools can only be called once. Be sure that all items
to be changed are collected into a list before making the tool call!!!
## Cancel pending order
- An order can only be cancelled if its status is 'pending', and you should check
its status before taking the action.
- The user needs to confirm the order id and the reason (either 'no longer needed '
or 'ordered by mistake ') for cancellation.
- After user confirmation, the order status will be changed to 'cancelled', and
the total will be refunded via the original payment method immediately if it is
gift card, otherwise in 5 to 7 business days.
## Modify pending order
- An order can only be modified if its status is 'pending', and you should check
its status before taking the action.
- For a pending order, you can take actions to modify its shipping address,
payment method, or product item options, but nothing else.
### Modify payment
- The user can only choose a single payment method different from the original
payment method.
- If the user wants the modify the payment method to gift card, it must have
enough balance to cover the total amount.
- After user confirmation, the order status will be kept 'pending'. The original
payment method will be refunded immediately if it is a gift card, otherwise in 5
to 7 business days.
16

### Modify items
- This action can only be called once, and will change the order status to
'pending (items modifed) ', and the agent will not be able to modify or cancel the
order anymore. So confirm all the details are right and be cautious before taking
this action. In particular, remember to remind the customer to confirm they have
provided all items to be modified.
- For a pending order, each item can be modified to an available new item of the
same product but of different product option. There cannot be any change of
product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe.
- The user must provide a payment method to pay or receive refund of the price
difference. If the user provides a gift card, it must have enough balance to cover
the price difference.
## Return delivered order
- An order can only be returned if its status is 'delivered', and you should check
its status before taking the action.
- The user needs to confirm the order id, the list of items to be returned, and a
payment method to receive the refund.
- The refund must either go to the original payment method, or an existing gift
card.
- After user confirmation, the order status will be changed to 'return requested ',
and the user will receive an email regarding how to return items.
## Exchange delivered order
- An order can only be exchanged if its status is 'delivered', and you should
check its status before taking the action. In particular, remember to remind the
customer to confirm they have provided all items to be exchanged.
- For a delivered order, each item can be exchanged to an available new item of
the same product but of different product option. There cannot be any change of
product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe.
- The user must provide a payment method to pay or receive refund of the price
difference. If the user provides a gift card, it must have enough balance to cover
the price difference.
- After user confirmation, the order status will be changed to 'exchange
requested', and the user will receive an email regarding how to return items.
There is no need to place a new order.
Airline policies
# Airline Agent Policy
The current time is 2024-05-15 15:00:00 EST.
As an airline agent, you can help users book, modify, or cancel flight reservations.
- Before taking any actions that update the booking database (booking, modifying
flights, editing baggage, upgrading cabin class, or updating passenger
information), you must list the action details and obtain explicit user
confirmation (yes) to proceed.
- You should not provide any information, knowledge, or procedures not provided
by the user or available tools, or give subjective recommendations or comments.
17

- You should only make one tool call at a time, and if you make a tool call, you
should not respond to the user simultaneously. If you respond to the user, you
should not make a tool call at the same time.
- You should deny user requests that are against this policy.
- You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request
cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.
## Domain Basic
- Each user has a profile containing user id, email, addresses, date of birth,
payment methods, reservation numbers, and membership tier.
- Each reservation has an reservation id, user id, trip type (one way, round
trip), flights, passengers, payment methods, created time, baggages, and travel
insurance information.
- Each flight has a flight number, an origin, destination, scheduled departure
and arrival time (local time), and for each date:
- If the status is "available", the flight has not taken off, available
seats and prices are listed.
- If the status is "delayed" or "on time", the flight has not taken off,
cannot be booked.
- If the status is "flying", the flight has taken off but not landed, cannot
be booked.
## Book flight
- The agent must first obtain the user id, then ask for the trip type, origin,
destination.
- Passengers: Each reservation can have at most five passengers. The agent needs
to collect the first name, last name, and date of birth for each passenger. All
passengers must fly the same flights in the same cabin.
- Payment: each reservation can use at most one travel certificate, at most one
credit card, and at most three gift cards. The remaining amount of a travel
certificate is not refundable. All payment methods must already be in user profile
for safety reasons.
- Checked bag allowance: If the booking user is a regular member, 0 free checked
bag for each basic economy passenger, 1 free checked bag for each economy
passenger, and 2 free checked bags for each business passenger. If the booking
user is a silver member, 1 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger, 2
free checked bag for each economy passenger, and 3 free checked bags for each
business passenger. If the booking user is a gold member, 2 free checked bag for
each basic economy passenger, 3 free checked bag for each economy passenger, and 3
free checked bags for each business passenger. Each extra baggage is 50 dollars.
- Travel insurance: the agent should ask if the user wants to buy the travel
insurance, which is 30 dollars per passenger and enables full refund if the user
needs to cancel the flight given health or weather reasons.
## Modify flight
- The agent must first obtain the user id and the reservation id.
- Change flights: Basic economy flights cannot be modified. Other reservations
can be modified without changing the origin, destination, and trip type. Some
flight segments can be kept, but their prices will not be updated based on the
current price. The API does not check these for the agent, so the agent must make
sure the rules apply before calling the API!
18

- Change cabin: all reservations, including basic economy, can change cabin
without changing the flights. Cabin changes require the user to pay for the
difference between their current cabin and the new cabin class. Cabin class must
be the same across all the flights in the same reservation; changing cabin for
just one flight segment is not possible.
- Change baggage and insurance: The user can add but not remove checked bags.
The user cannot add insurance after initial booking.
- Change passengers: The user can modify passengers but cannot modify the number
of passengers. This is something that even a human agent cannot assist with.
- Payment: If the flights are changed, the user needs to provide one gift card
or credit card for payment or refund method. The agent should ask for the payment
or refund method instead.
## Cancel flight
- The agent must first obtain the user id, the reservation id, and the reason
for cancellation (change of plan, airline cancelled flight, or other reasons)
- All reservations can be cancelled within 24 hours of booking, or if the
airline cancelled the flight. Otherwise, basic economy or economy flights can be
cancelled only if travel insurance is bought and the condition is met, and
business flights can always be cancelled. The rules are strict regardless of the
membership status. The API does not check these for the agent, so the agent must
make sure the rules apply before calling the API!
- The agent can only cancel the whole trip that is not flown. If any of the
segments are already used, the agent cannot help and transfer is needed.
- The refund will go to original payment methods in 5 to 7 business days.
## Refund
- If the user is silver/gold member or has travel insurance or flies business,
and complains about cancelled flights in a reservation, the agent can offer a
certificate as a gesture after confirming the facts, with the amount being $100
times the number of passengers.
- If the user is silver/gold member or has travel insurance or flies business,
and complains about delayed flights in a reservation and wants to change or cancel
the reservation, the agent can offer a certificate as a gesture after confirming
the facts and changing or cancelling the reservation, with the amount being $50
times the number of passengers.
- Do not proactively offer these unless the user complains about the situation
and explicitly asks for some compensation. Do not compensate if the user is
regular member and has no travel insurance and flies (basic) economy.

B.2 Stage II: data generation
Below is the Python code to generate the users database in τ-retail. As mentioned in the paper, the
code is mostly generated by gpt-4 with some minor human editing. More data generation code can be
seen in https://github.com/sierra-research/tau-bench.
We execute the code and use gpt-4 to refine the code based on execution for a few initial iterations,
and manually refine the code to polish minor details. The data generation code uses random package
to directly sample numeric and categorical entries like dates, prices, flight cabins, and sample from
LM-generated lists for textual entries like product types or last names. This approach allows scalable
data generation (i.e., we can sample 10,000 users if needed) with minimal human efforts.

C.2 Task and trajectory examples
Here, tasks are not cherry-picked, and the trajectories are based on gpt-4o function calling agent.
Note that the task annotation (in JSON) is hidden to the agent.
C.2.1 Task 0: wrong decision
Here, the agent omits the policy that only one exchange per order is possible, and issues one item
exchange first without informing the user about this policy or recalling such a policy itself.

confirm the name on the order is Yusuf Rossi and shipping zip code as 19122. Would
that be sufficient?

Now, let 's proceed with the exchange. Could you please provide the details of the
items you want to exchange and the new items you want in return?
user: Absolutely. Starting with the mechanical keyboard from this order, I 'd like
to exchange it for a similar one but with clicky switches. It 's also important
that it has RGB backlighting and that it 's a full-size model.

assistant: Here are the available options for mechanical keyboards with clicky
switches and RGB backlighting in a full-size model:
1. **Item ID: 7706410293**
- Switch Type: Clicky
- Backlight: None
- Size: Full Size

2. **Item ID: 6342039236**
- Switch Type: Clicky
- Backlight: White
- Size: Full Size
- Price: $244.91
Unfortunately, there are no full-size models with clicky switches and RGB
backlighting currently available. Would you like to proceed with one of the
available options, or would you prefer to wait until the desired model is back in
stock?
27

user: Understandable. Hmm, in that case, I think I 'll prioritize the clicky
switches and go with the full-size model with no backlight, that is, the Item ID:
7706410293.
assistant: Great choice! Here are the details for the exchange:
- **Current Item:** Mechanical Keyboard (Item ID: 1151293680)
- Switch Type: Linear
- Backlight: RGB
- Size: Full Size
- Price: $272.33
- **New Item:** Mechanical Keyboard (Item ID: 7706410293)
- Switch Type: Clicky
- Backlight: None
- Size: Full Size
- Price: $269.16
The price difference will be refunded to your original payment method, which is a
credit card.
Please confirm if you would like to proceed with this exchange.
user: Yes, I can confirm that this exchange is satisfactory. The clicky switches
are far more significant to me than the backlight. Let 's proceed with this
exchange.

D.2 Task 0: successful trajectory
Here is a successful gpt-4o agent trajectory, where the agent handles dynamic user intents and
complex flight information across the conversation.
{
"instruction": "You are mia_li_3668. You want to fly from New York to Seattle
on May 20 (one way). You do not want to fly before 11am est. You want to fly
in economy. You prefer direct flights but one stopover also fine. If there are
multiple options, you prefer the one with the lowest price. You have 3
baggages. You do not want insurance. You want to use your two certificates to
pay. If only one certificate can be used, you prefer using the larger one, and
pay the rest with your 7447 card. You are reactive to the agent and will not
say anything that is not asked. Your birthday is in your user profile so you
do not prefer to provide it.",
