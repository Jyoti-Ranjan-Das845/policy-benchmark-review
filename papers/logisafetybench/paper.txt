Abstract
The integration of large language models
(LLMs) into autonomous agents has enabled
complex tool use, yet in high-stakes domains,
these systems must strictly adhere to regulatory
standards beyond simple functional correctness.
However, existing benchmarks often overlook
implicit regulatory compliance, thus failing to
evaluate whether LLMs can autonomously en-
force mandatory safety constraints. To fill this
gap, we introduce LOGISAFETYGEN, a frame-
work that converts unstructured regulations into
Linear Temporal Logic oracles and employs
logic-guided fuzzing to synthesize valid, safety-
critical traces. Building on this framework, we
construct LOGISAFETYBENCH, a benchmark
comprising 240 human-verified tasks that re-
quire LLMs to generate Python programs that
satisfy both functional objectives and latent
compliance rules. Evaluations of 13 state-of-
the-art (SOTA) LLMs reveal that larger mod-
els, despite achieving better functional correct-
ness, frequently prioritize task completion over
safety, which results in non-compliant behav-
ior.

external tools, and interact with the physical or dig-
ital world to achieve multi-step goals (Qin et al.,
2024). While this capability extends far beyond
that of traditional chatbots, it also introduces sub-
stantially higher safety and regulatory risks. In
high-stakes domains such as financial services, le-
gal reasoning, healthcare, and smart home control,
functional task completion alone is insufficient;
LLMs must consistently satisfy safety and regu-
latory constraints throughout the entire decision-
making and execution process. Violations may
result in severe consequences (Ye et al., 2024; Ra-
dosevich and Halloran, 2025), including physical
harm and regulatory non-compliance.
To mitigate such risks, systematic evaluation
and pre-deployment testing are essential for under-
standing an LLM’s capability boundaries and for
building trust among developers, regulators, and
end-users. In particular, evaluation must jointly as-
sess whether an LLM can (1) achieve the intended
functional goal and also (2) adhere to mandatory
safety constraints under realistic interaction sce-
narios. However, existing evaluation practices fall
short of this requirement.
On the one hand, current benchmarks largely
rely on static test sets derived from manual cura-
tion or web scraping. These datasets are expen-
sive to scale (Zhang et al., 2024a), difficult to vali-
date (Huang et al., 2025), and prone to data satura-
tion (Chen et al., 2025a). More critically, they pri-
marily evaluate functional correctness, while treat-
ing safety or regulatory compliance as secondary
or implicit. On the other hand, real-world safety
constraints are often specified in lengthy natural
language policy documents, such as regulatory acts
(e.g., EU AI Act (EU, 2024)) or internal compli-
ance manuals, making it prohibitively costly to
involve domain experts in mapping relevant rules
to possible user instructions or execution traces.
To address these limitations, we propose LO-
GISAFETYGEN, an automated framework for syn-

thesizing high-quality test cases for safety-critical
LLMs. LOGISAFETYGENtakes tool specifications
and regulation documents as input and automati-
cally generates test scenarios with explicit, verifi-
able safety constraints. The framework consists of
three stages. (1) Automated Oracle Construction,
which translates unstructured policy documents
into deterministic Linear Temporal Logic (LTL)
over finite traces, establishing a formal “gold stan-
dard” for compliance. (2) Logic-Guided Trace Gen-
eration, which leverages a fuzzing engine to syn-
thesize executable ground-truth traces that are com-
pliant with both tool semantics and temporal safety
constraints by construction. (3) Safety Masking,
which converts these traces into natural language
instructions that omit mandatory safety steps, forc-
ing LLMs to infer implicit constraints from context
that closely reflect real-world user interactions.
We instantiate LOGISAFETYGENin three repre-
sentative high-stakes domains—Financial Services,
Tele-Healthcare, and Smart Home IoT—and con-
struct LOGISAFETYBENCH, a benchmark of 240
manually verified test cases. Each requires LLMs
to interleave task-oriented reasoning with manda-
tory safety operations under temporal constraints.
Our contributions are summarized as follows:
• We introduce LOGISAFETYGEN, an automated
benchmark generation framework that integrates
LTL-based formal verification with logic-guided
fuzzing to produce safety-critical test cases.
• We propose a Dual-Oracle Evaluation protocol
that jointly verifies functional correctness and
strict temporal safety compliance, thus enabling
precise measurement of the Inference Gap be-
tween task success and rule adherence.
• We release LOGISAFETYBENCH, a challenging,
human-verified benchmark spanning three high-
stakes domains, which require LLMs to satisfy
implicit regulatory constraints during execution.
• We conduct a systematic evaluation of SOTA
LLMs, showing that although scaling improves
general reasoning ability, it does not resolve fail-
ures in implicit regulatory compliance.

Trustworthiness Evaluation of LLM.A grow-
ing body of work aims to provide benchmarks
on the safety, security, and regulatory compliance
of LLM-based systems, which is crucial for their
trustworthy deployment in real-world (Moham-
madi et al., 2025). Early work, such as Agen-
tHarm (Andriushchenko et al., 2025; Mazeika et al.,
2024), analyzes LLM behavior under malicious
user requests. While important, these scenarios
differ from evaluating rule adherence under be-
nign conditions and mainly focus on question-
answering tasks. More recent frameworks, in-
cluding ToolEmu (Ruan et al., 2024), Agent-
SafetyBench (Zhang et al., 2024b), and Agent-
Bench (Liu et al., 2024), examine general tool-use
safety beyond simple QA. However, in these set-
tings, safety largely means correct tool manipula-
tion rather than interpreting regulations in text and
following specific rules.
In a related but distinct direction, researchers be-
gin to anchor evaluation in explicit regulatory con-
texts. EU-Agent-Bench (Lichkovski et al., 2025)
and HSE-Bench (Wang et al., 2025a) introduce
evaluation scenarios derived from concrete policies
and standards, while RuleArena (Zhou et al., 2025)
and CNFinBench (Ding et al., 2025) move closer
to structured rule reasoning by embedding real-
world regulations into their tasks. These bench-
marks test agents’ ability to interpret and reason
about regulatory constraints expressed in natural
language, but they do not require LLMs to generate
executable tool-call scripts that satisfy formal com-
pliance rules, which can be essential in real-world
LLM-based agent deployment.
Benchmark Construction Methods.One ma-
jor approach to benchmark construction is to col-
lect high-quality data with human effort. Hu-
manEval (Chen et al., 2021) is one of the classic ex-
amples in this category. Some benchmarks also ex-
pand their coverage by using web crawlers and then
applying manual annotation. In tool-use evaluation,
BFCL (Patil et al., 2025) is a representative exam-
ple that relies on crawling large-scale repositories.
However, since manual benchmarks are both costly
and potentially contaminated (Zhu et al., 2024),
researchers have explored LLM-in-the-loop bench-
mark generation as a more scalable alternative.
In these approaches, models help synthesize test
instances automatically (Ghazaryan et al., 2025).
Notable examples include AutoCodeBench (Chou
et al., 2025), which generates code-centric tasks,
and MCPBench (Wang et al., 2025c), which pro-
duces tool-use test cases with LLM assistance. Al-
though these methods reduce annotation effort and
broaden evaluation scope, the stochastic nature of
LLM generation makes it hard to guarantee strict

correctness or compliance with specific rules.
To support tasks that demand rigorous adherence
to complex rules, recent work has proposed sup-
plementing deterministic, rule-driven mechanisms
with a human/LLM-in-the-loop process. Closest
to our setting is ShieldAgent (Chen et al., 2025b),
which uses probabilistic rule circuits to constrain
agent trajectories; however, it is designed as a run-
time defense against adversarial attacks, whereas
our framework serves as an offline stress test of
compliance. Similarly, StateEval (Huang et al.,
2025) introduces state-aware test generation for
sequential API calls, focusing on functional cor-
rectness rather than regulatory compliance.
3 Methodology
3.1 Overview
We formalize the problem ofsafety-aware LLM
evaluationas follows: Given a toolset T and a
regulatory policy P, our goal is to automatically
synthesize a test case (I,S ∗,Φ task) where I rep-
resents user instructions, S ∗ specifies the desired
target states, and Φtask encodes the applicable reg-
ulatory constraints. The states S ∗ are guaranteed
to be reachable by a valid ground-truth API invoca-
tion trace τ which is generated alongside the test
case. To achieve fully automated synthesis, we
must overcome three inherent technical challenges:
(1) The Ambiguity Gap.Regulations in P are
unstructured natural language, and typically lack
the required mathematical determinism to support
automated verification.
(2) The Validity Gap.Naively using LLMs to
generate traces often results in hallucinated API
calls or invalid arguments, rendering the test cases
non-executable.
(3) The Inference Gap.Simply stating safety rules
in the instruction I is trivial; a rigorous test must
ensure the LLM caninferimplicit constraints from
context, simulating real-world compliance.
We address these three critical gaps via our
method LOGISAFETYGEN. As illustrated in Fig-
ure 1, our framework generates test cases by se-
quentially addressing three critical gaps in com-
pliance testing: First, 1⃝ Automated Safety Ora-
cle Construction (Section 3.2) addresses theAm-
biguity Gapby translating unstructured regula-
tions into deterministic Linear Temporal Logic
(LTLf ) constraints, establishing a verifiable math-
ematical gold standard ( Φ). Next, 2⃝ the Logic-
Guided Trace Generation (Section 3.3) compo-
nent bridges theValidity Gapby employing a
constraint-satisfaction fuzzing engine to synthesize
ground truth traces (τ ∗) that are guaranteed to be
executable. Finally, 3⃝ Safety Masking and Instruc-
tion Synthesis (Section 3.4) targets theInference
Gapusing a translation-masking strategy to gener-
ate user prompts (I) that explicitly describe busi-
ness goals while strictly omitting the safety steps
found in τ ∗. This pipeline enables the rigorous
testing of an LLM’s ability to autonomously infer
mandatory regulatory constraints from the system
context.
3.2 Automated Safety Oracle Construction
Establishing a gold standard for compliance from
massive, unstructured regulatory texts is non-trivial.
Unlike robotics approaches restricted to closed vo-
cabularies (Pan et al., 2023), API-based environ-
ments are prone to ambiguity and hallucination. To
bridge thisAmbiguity Gap, we design a pipeline
3

that enforces strict grounding.
Rule Extraction. We first leverage LLMs to distill
regulations into atomic constraints, applyingScope
AlignmentandConstraint Deduplicationto retain
only relevant policies. Furthermore, rather than al-
lowing unconstrained free-form logical translation
with LLMs, we restrict all extracted constraints
to two LTL templates that capture the dominant
forms of compliance logic in business, as observed
in prior work (Chen et al., 2025b). Specifically,
we adopt a dual-template formulation comprising:
(1)Operational Restrictionswhich forbid a sensi-
tive action P2 until a check P1 holds, formalized
as ¬((¬P1)UP 2); (2)Instruction Adherencere-
quires that a trigger P1 implies a future outcome
P2, formalized as□(P 1 → ⋄P 2).
Rule Validation.Template-based genera-
tion yields a set of candidate formulas Φcand,
which may still reference semantically plausi-
ble but non-existent predicates (e.g., hallucinated
verify_user vs. the concrete check_auth). To
guarantee executability, we subjectΦcand to a deter-
ministicSignature Validatorthat eliminates any for-
mula containing predicates not already defined in
the API schema. This grounding step ensures that
all retained Safety Oracles Φ are syntactically valid
and computationally solvable by the fuzzer, thus
completing the automated logic extraction pipeline.
3.3 Logic-Guided Trace Generation
With the formal Safety Oracles (Φ) established, our
next goal is to synthesize concrete execution traces
(τ). These ordered tool invocation sequences serve
as the ground-truth solutions for our benchmark,
providing the “gold standard” behavior for how an
ideal LLM can interleave functional reasoning with
mandatory safety checks to satisfy the constraints
in Φ. However, generating the ground-truth se-
quences creates theValidity Gap. Naively relying
on direct LLM prompting is insufficient, as proba-
bilistic models prioritize semantic fluency over exe-
cutability, and frequently hallucinate inappropriate
parameters or violate temporal dependencies.
To bridge this gap, we adopt Fuzzing (Zhu et al.,
2022), a dynamic testing paradigm that discovers
valid execution paths by systematically exploring
the state space under strict constraints. Unlike stan-
dard text generation, our fuzzer treats trace con-
struction as a bounded search problem: it itera-
tively proposes candidate actions and rejects any
that fail to meet formal specifications. We imple-
ment a safety-constrained fuzzer (with ≈3600 lines
of code) that constructs traces τ= [a 1, a2, ..., ak]
incrementally. The core of the fuzzer is a Dual-
Constraint Pruning Mechanism. At each step t,
given the current environment state St, the fuzzer
samples a potential action at+1 and validates it
against two strict boundaries.
Precondition Satisfaction (Vschema):The action
must be executable in the current state St. This
ensures that the trace is functionally sound.
Safety Satisfaction (Vsafe):The updated trace τt+1
must satisfy the LTL Safety Oracles. We verify
this using a runtime LTL monitor: Vsafe(τt+1) =
True⇐ ⇒ ∀ϕ∈Φ, τ t+1 |=ϕ.
To operationalize these checks efficiently, we
employ a Bottom-Up Depth-First Search strategy
Traditional top-down planning requires pre-solving
constraints for the entire API call graph, but with
complex LTL rules, this becomes computationally
intractable. In contrast, our bottom-up approach
enables Lazy Evaluation. We compute the valid
search space and check compliance only for the
immediate next step (St →S t+1). If a candidate
action violates either the schema or the safety con-
straint, the branch is immediately pruned.
When the fuzzer attempts a business action that
violates a safety constraint (LTL), the LTL mon-
itor triggers a violation ( Vsafe =False ), pruning
that path. The search is then forced to backtrack
and explore alternative branches until it selects the
mandatory safety operation. By iterating this pro-
cess until the target trace length is reached, the
fuzzer produces a ground truth trace τ ∗ where ev-
ery user action is wrapped in the necessary safety
checks, guaranteeing that the test case is solvable,
executable, and strictly compliant by construction.
3.4 Safety Masking and Instruction Synthesis
Phase 2⃝ yields a ground truth trace τ ∗ that is exe-
cutable and fully compliant. However, real-world
LLMs are typically driven by natural language re-
quests, rather than code sequences. To simulate
authentic user interactions, we must translate these
executable traces back into realistic user instruc-
tions. Critically, a naive translation would explic-
itly list every action, including safety checks, and
so would reduce the challenge to simple instruction
following. To make the evaluation more challeng-
ing and closer to real-world use, we convert explicit
safety requirements into implicit ones that require
the model to perform its own reasoning.
Safety Masking ( M).We address this by
introducing a masking function M that log-

ically filters out regulatory steps. Given the
executable trace τ ∗, we identify the subset of
actions Asafe ⊂τ ∗ corresponding to safety-critical
APIs. The masking function preserves only the
functional logic, preserving the order of opera-
tions: τbus =Filter(τ ∗,¬A safe). For example,
if τ ∗ is [CreateUser,Verify,GrantAccess] ,
the masked sequence τbus retains only
[CreateUser,GrantAccess] . The resulting
instruction I will thus be“Create a user and grant
them access”, which deliberately hides the Verify
step. This forces the LLM-Under-Test to infer the
omitted compliance requirement solely from the
policy context.
Instruction Typology.Real-world users interact
with LLMs in diverse ways, ranging from vague
goals to rigid commands. To assess robustness
under different forms of user input, we derive two
types of instructions from the masked trace:
• Goal-Oriented (Igoal):Describes only the final
desired outcome, which tests the planning ca-
pability by requiring the LLM to autonomously
decompose an abstract intent and insert necessary
safety precautions before execution.
• Workflow-Oriented (Iflow):Provides a specific
step-by-step procedure for the program logic.
This tests the compliance resilience by requiring
the LLM to resist the tendency to blindly fol-
low user orders and proactively interleave safety
checks despite the rigid instructions.
Implementation.To transform τbus into high-
quality instructions that adhere to these typologies,
we implement aGenerator-Evaluator Multi-agent
pipelineA generator agent synthesizes candidate
instructions, which are then critiqued by an eval-
uator agent for unambiguity (accurately reflecting
business parameters) and safety masking (ensuring
no safety hints leak).
Benchmark Evaluation Criteria.Given a gener-
ated test case T= (I,S ∗,Φ task) as the output of
the entire pipeline, an LLM is said to be successful
in the task if and only if it passes two oracles:
• Functional Oracle (S ∗):The LLM is function-
allysuccessfulif its final state matches the state
derived from the ground truth trace:S mut ≡ S ∗.
• Safety Oracle (Φtask):The LLM iscompliantif
its execution trace satisfies all hidden LTL con-
straints:∀ϕ∈Φ task, τmut |=ϕ.
These formulations allow us to quantify theInfer-
ence Gapby distinguishing between LLMs that
simply fail the task and those that achieve “Unsafe
Success”, correctly executing the business logic
while violating regulatory constraints.
4 Benchmark Construction
We present LOGISAFETYBENCH, the first evalua-
tion suite designed to rigorously measure implicit
regulatory compliance in LLM tool calling. Com-
prising 240 verified tasks, it serves as the concrete
instantiation of the LOGISAFETYGENframework.
We use GPT-5-Mini as the backbone engine for
policy extraction and instruction synthesis, cho-
sen for its balance of reasoning capability and cost
efficiency. In this section, we detail the scenario
selection and verification protocols that establish
the benchmark’s quality, contrasting our approach
with prior work.
As shown in Table 1, existing benchmarks do
not simultaneously satisfy the three requirements
of regulatory testing: (1)Implicit Safety:Bench-
marks such as ToolSword (Ye et al., 2024) em-
phasize adversarial attacks rather than failures
caused by passive neglect of safety rules. (2)
Formal Oracle:Frameworks such as Agent-
SafetyBench (Zhang et al., 2024b) depend on LLM-
based judges, which introduce non-determinism
and evaluation bias. (3)Executable Environ-
ments:Many existing benchmarks (Ruan et al.,
2024) lack executable ground truth and only rely
on static checking. LOGISAFETYBENCHuniquely
integrates Logic-Guided Fuzzing to ensure more
robust compliance both by trace validity and Safety
Masking to enforce implicit compliance, thus pro-
viding an executable sandbox where LLMs are
graded against formal LTL constraints.

4.1 Scenario Selection
We instantiate LOGISAFETYGENacross three high-
stakes domains where safety failures carry severe
consequences. Tool specifications are adapted from
ToolEmu (Ruan et al., 2024), and safety oracles are
anchored in authoritative international regulations:
Financial Services.Based on the European Union
Payment Services Directive 2 (EU, 2015), this do-
main tests whether an LLM can enforce safety con-
straints during online banking services.
Tele-Healthcare.Based on the USA HIPAA Secu-
rity Rule (HHS, 1996), a widely accepted standard
for protecting health information, LLMs must com-
ply with safety constraints while handling patients’
sensitive records.
Smart Home IoT.Based on the European Telecom-
munications Standards Institute EN 303 645 stan-
dard (ETSI, 2024), a leading international policy
for consumer IoT security, it tests LLMs’ ability to
reason about physical safety risks like door locks.
4.2 Human Verification Protocol
Although LOGISAFETYGENis fully automated,
constructing a rigorous benchmark requires expert
validation for reliable reference behavior. We em-
ploy a human verification protocol that first reviews
the regulatory logic and then validates the concrete
test cases derived from it.
Safety Oracle Verification.First, we examined the
LTL formulas generated in Section 3.2 to ensure
the fuzzer operates on legally sound constraints.
To ensure consistency, all authors independently
reviewed every candidate across three rounds, re-
taining only those that achieved unanimous agree-
ment. The pipeline achieved an aggregate accep-
tance rate of 73.9% across the three domains. This
high consistency confirms that our Automated Or-
acle Construction pipeline can effectively distill
unstructured policies into legally sound, determin-
istic logic, thereby resolving theAmbiguity Gap.
Instruction and Masking Verification.Using the
verified oracles, the pipeline generated candidate
test tuples (I, τ ∗). We then labeled these outputs
to curate the final benchmark. Each author was
responsible for one scenario, labeling candidates
until the target quota of 40 validpairedsamples
was met. Overall, candidates were accepted at a
rate of 70.6%, yielding a final benchmark of 240
evaluation tasks (120 paired samples).
5 Evaluation
Our evaluation has two parts, targeting different
components of the study. First, we evaluate LO-
GISAFETYGENitself, measuring its ability to pro-
duce valid and structurally diverse test cases using
coverage metrics (Section 5.2). This analysis fo-
cuses on how effectively the framework explores
complex tool interactions and state-dependent be-
haviors. Second, we use the LOGISAFETYBENCH
generated by our framework to evaluate SOTA
LLMs. This evaluation measures how well dif-
ferent models handle safety requirements that are
implicit, revealing their ability to reason about regu-
latory constraints in realistic settings (Section 5.3).
5.1 Experimental Setup
We evaluatethirteenLLMs, including frontier
commercial APIs (e.g., GPT-5 series, Gemini-2.5
series), and a diverse range of open-weight architec-
tures, including both general-purpose instruction-
tuned models (e.g., Llama-3.1-8B, DeepSeek-R1-
Distill-Qwen-14B) and specialized code LLMs
(e.g., Qwen-Coder). Due to space limitations, we
select onlyeightrepresentative models (Figure 2)
to report in the main text.
In all experiments, for every test case Ti, the
LLM is initialized with a system prompt containing
the Tool Schema (Dapi), the Raw Regulatory Doc-
ument (Ptxt), and the User Instruction ( I) where
explicit safety requirements are removed. In this
case, LLMs must plan their actions under the regu-
lations without explicit guidance.
5.2 Evaluation of LOGISAFETYGEN
We first assess the effectiveness of ourLogic-
Guided Fuzzer. In particular, we examine whether
it can produce execution traces with sufficient di-
versity. Diversity is essential for most benchmarks,
as it ensures that the test set covers a broad range
of behaviors rather than being biased toward some
specific scenarios. Moreover, many regulatory vio-
lations arise only under rare combinations of tool
states that lie in the tail of the behavior distribution.
Capturing such edge cases, therefore, requires a
diverse test set. Prior work (Yao et al.; Lee et al.,
2025; Wang et al., 2025b) commonly usescoverage
criteria to quantify diversity in test generation.
When selecting baselines for comparison on the
diversity of generated traces, we find that the LLM-
based approach is the only scalable solution. Al-
though alternative approaches such as symbolic

execution can, in principle, produce traces, they
require substantial manual adaptation and are there-
fore beyond the scope of this study. However,
naive LLM-based generation also suffers from the
Sampling Bias Problem: they often converge on
high-likelihood paths (Yang and Holtzman, 2025;
Sivaprasad et al., 2025), failing to traverse the
complex edge cases with important safety mech-
anisms (Huang et al., 2025; Xia et al., 2024). It
remains the case that scalability and sufficient di-
versity are critical in the long run. To validate this,
we implement a comparative baseline using GPT-5-
Mini, prompted to generate diverse API programs
using the same constraints as our fuzzer. We assess
the quality of the generated test cases using two
complementary coverage metrics:
Safety Critical API Coverage (S.C. Cov):We
begin with a coarse-grained coverage measure that
captures whether generated traces exercise the APIs
directly involved in safety enforcement. Specif-
ically, S.C. Cov measures the proportion of the
safety-critical API subset covered by the generated
traces. To compute that, we first manually identify
the set of safety-critical APIs as ground truth, and
then measure how many of these APIs are included
across the 40 traces generated by each method.
Adjacent Transition Coverage (ATC):While S.C.
Cov indicates whether safety-critical APIs are in-
voked at all, it does not capture how these APIs
are composed into action sequences. Safety risks
often arise from specific state transitions triggered
by sequences of actions, rather than from isolated
API calls. To capture this sequential aspect, we
adopt ATC (Huang et al., 2025), which measures
the diversity of local execution structures. For a
traceτ= [a 1, ..., aN], this metric is defined as:
ATC= |(ai, ai+1)|1≤i < N|
|A|2 (1)
where A denotes the set of unique APIs. This
metric aims to capture how APIs are connected
within execution sequences rather than how often

ical API Coverage (S.C. Cov)across three scenarios.

age of state transitions and greater structural diver-
sity in the generated tests.
Results.Table 2 presents the comparative results.
OurLogic-Guided Fuzzerdemonstrates superior
effectiveness, achieving 100% Safety Critical API
Coverage across all domains. In contrast, the
LLM-only baseline shows a significantly lower
coverage rate (e.g., missing 20% of safety APIs
inSmart Home IoT), indicating that purely proba-
bilistic sampling struggles to incorporate important
safety-related operations. Moreover, our method
consistently achieves higher ATC than the LLM-
based baseline across all domains, with the largest
improvement observed inTele-Healthcaresetting
(23.4% vs. 85.6%). This result aligns with previous
findings (Huang et al., 2025) that LLMs suffer from
theSampling Bias Problemin test case generation.
By treating trace generation as a constraint satis-
faction problem rather than a text generation task,
our framework systematically explores the combi-
natorial boundaries of the API schema, ensuring
that LOGISAFETYBENCHcontains the structural
complexity required for safety evaluation.
5.3 Results on LOGISAFETYBENCH
We now apply LOGISAFETYBENCHto evaluate the
compliance capabilities of eight foundation models
across three domains and two instruction typolo-
gies. We employ Pass@1 (Chen et al., 2021) (Safe
Success Rate) as our primary metric. A test case
passes if and only if the LLM achieves the func-
tional goal and satisfies all hidden LTL constraints.

Figure 3:Failure Mode Analysis (Goal).This heatmap details the failure rates across four distinct categories: (1)
Syntax Errors, (2)Semantic Errors, (3)Instruction Adherenceviolations, and (4)Operational Restrictionviolations.
We classify failures into three modes: Benign Fail-
ure (task failed safely), Unsafe Failure (safety vio-
lation + task failure), and the most critical Unsafe
Success (task completion via rule violation).
Performance Analysis.Figure 2 indicates a gen-
eral positive correlation between LLMs’ capa-
bility and safety compliance. Frontier commer-
cial models (e.g., GPT-5) consistently outperform
open-weight ones, confirming that strong general-
purpose reasoning is the bedrock upon which safety
behaviors are built. However, the margin of success
is heavily modulated byAPI Density, defined as
the number of distinct safety-critical tools provided
in the testing scenario. InFinancial Services(4
safety APIs), GPT-5 demonstrates near-perfect per-
formance. In contrast, theSmart Home IoTdomain
(10 safety APIs) induces a combinatorial explosion
in the underlying state space. This creates a depth
of planning that challenges even the most capable
models. It is thus confirmed that by manipulating
API density, our framework can effectively stratify
model performance, providing a rigorous stress test
that distinguishes even between top-tier LLMs.
Impact of Instruction Typology.Comparing
workflow-oriented vs. goal-oriented instructions re-
veals how compliance stability varies with user in-
teraction styles. Under workflow guidance, models
perform robustly because the planning structure is
provided. However, removing this scaffolding trig-
gers a collapse. InSmart Home IoT, GPT-5 drops
from 75% Pass@1 (Workflow) to 28% (Goal). This
decline indicates that while models can execute
safety checks when the business logic is explic-
itly structured, they struggle to autonomously in-
terleave these checks when planning from a high-
level intent. Furthermore, this drop reflects a shift
towards unsafe behavior rather than mere incom-
petence. InTele-Healthcare, Gemini-Pro’s Unsafe
Success Rate rises significantly when switching to
Goal-Oriented prompts. This confirms that without
rigid workflow scaffolding, LLMs tend to prioritize
functional success over safety constraints.
Diagnosing Failure Reasons.We conduct a fail-
ure analysis (Figure 3) to uncover the specific rea-
soning deficits behind functional incorrectness and
non-compliance. We focus on Goal-Oriented as it
forces autonomous planning, directly exposing the
reasoning deficits behind non-compliance. Failures
are categorized into four modes:Syntax Errors(in-
valid code),Semantic Errors(API hallucinations),
Instruction Adherence Violations(omitted safety
actions), andOperational Restriction Violations
(ordering errors). We observe no universal fail-
ure pattern across domains or model families, indi-
cating that compliance failures are highly context-
dependent and difficult to prevent.
Syntax vs. Semantic Grounding.We observe
a sharp divergence between code validity and util-
ity.Syntax Errorsare negligible across all models,
indicating strong mastery of Python structure, yet
Semantic Errorspersist unexpectedly even in fron-
tier models. For instance, Gemini-Pro exhibits a
50% semantic failure rate inFinancial Services,
and Gemini-Flash reaches 80% inSmart Home IoT.
This shows that high-level reasoning capabilities
do not guarantee robust API grounding.
Divergent Scaling Trends.Regarding safety
violations (Instruction AdherenceandOperational
Restrictions), we observe contrasting behaviors be-
tween model families. The GPT-5 series exhibits
a positive scaling trend, where more capable mod-
els (e.g., GPT-5) tend to commit fewer safety vi-
olations than their smaller counterparts. In con-
trast, the Gemini family defies this logic; the ca-
pable Gemini-Pro frequently performs worse than
Gemini-Flash (e.g., 57% adherence violations in
Tele-Healthcare). This inconsistency suggests that
for some architectures, scaling capability does not
inherently resolve safety non-compliance.
6 Conclusion
We propose LOGISAFETYGEN, an automated
framework that uses logic-guided fuzzing and
8

safety masking to synthesize verifiable compliance
test cases. By instantiating it, we introduce LO-
GISAFETYBENCH, a human-verified suite of 240
tasks anchored in real-world regulations. Our re-
sults reveal that while SOTA LLMs possess the rea-
soning capability to execute workflows, they lack
the autonomy to infer implicit safety constraints,
frequently prioritizing functional success over reg-
ulatory adherence. This work establishes a vital
foundation for measuring and improving the regu-
latory compliance of autonomous agents.
Limitations
Representation Limits of Safety Oracles.Our
framework establishes a gold standard by ground-
ing regulations in deterministic LTL. To help au-
tomate LTL synthesis, we restrict these oracles to
two dominant templates—Operational Restriction
and Instruction Adherence. This abstraction fo-
cuses exclusively on the temporal ordering of API
calls, limiting our ability to analyze the safety of
specific function arguments (e.g., verifying that a
transfer amount is within a safe limit or detecting
malicious payloads in valid calls). Consequently,
policies requiring deep semantic inspection of pa-
rameter values or probabilistic judgment cannot be
formalized. Future work could explore designing
more sophisticated logic representations to extend
our safety oracles to capture fine-grained data-flow
and parameter-level constraints.
Dependence on Generator Capability.Although
LOGISAFETYGENautomates the synthesis of valid
traces via fuzzing, the initial diversity of the test
scenarios is partially bounded by the creative pri-
ors of the backbone LLM used for seeding. While
our human verification protocol ensures the final
benchmark is high-quality, we observed that purely
automated generation can still struggle with ex-
treme structural novelty without human guidance.
As foundation models continue to scale, we antici-
pate that future generators will be better equipped
to propose diverse edge cases autonomously, fur-
ther reducing the reliance on human-in-the-loop
curation for high-stakes benchmarks.
Ethical Considerations
Given that our paper aims to unveil the implicit
compliance risks of LLMs, our publicly available
dataset includes test cases that simulate regulatory
violations across financial, healthcare, and IoT do-
mains. We emphasize that these scenarios are en-
tirely synthetic and constructed within a mock envi-
ronment, specifically intended for safety evaluation
and defensive red-teaming purposes to mitigate
real-world deployment risks.
